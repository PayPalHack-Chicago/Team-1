hello

`npm install`

to run the iOS simulator do `react-native run-ios`
some helpful commands:
`react-native link`
`react-native upgrade`
`cd ios && pod install`
`react-native eject && react-native upgrade`
`react-native link react-native-gesture-handler`

if you get a bundle error, do `react-native upgrade`, which should replace your xcode proj stuff
