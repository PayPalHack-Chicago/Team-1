# Hello, welcome to our Glim Project submission for PayPal Hack-Chicago!.

To run the project do `npm install`, then `react-native run-ios`. Make sure you're on the version of XCode compatible with your version of react-native. This project only works as intended on iPhone X, given the short time constraint of the project.

You may need to install pods, if that's the case do `cd ./ios && pod install`
